		<p class="my-parragraph">For the past 8 years, Mercedes has consecutively made the best car on the grid for each F1 season with fast and reliable vehicles that far outclass the rest of the grid, the German British based team 
		has dominated through various rule and design changes from 2014 to 2021, making disputably the best cars in F1 such as 2020's W11 which was considerably quicker than any opponent to the point that it is known as one of the best F1 cars (if not the best) of all time.</p>

		<p class="my-parragraph">however, the W13 has defeated the recent trends by not even being in the top 2 fastest cars on the grid, Mercedes is solely third on the constructor's championship because of the consistency of the drivers but the car itself is made for the midfeild. the major rule changes that made this happen include wheel changes from 12' to 18' which necessitated a major suspension system change and created more space between the wheels, putting more tension on the belly of the vehicle. another change is in the nose of the car with a drastically different approach than last year or the year before (a car worth replicating)
